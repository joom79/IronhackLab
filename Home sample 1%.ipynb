       "  \"As I said though, with its design I'm finding very little dust actually gather around the ozone generator part, so this basically just means it's really effective.\",\n",
       "  \"Another point in its favor is the fact that they're using a metal that doesn't oxidize quickly.\",\n",
       "  \"I don't know if ozone generators do this on purpose to try to force people to keep buying them, but ozone, quite obviously, causes things to oxidize by its very nature, so the fact that most use a metal that usually is just a copper alloy is basically designing them to decrease in function over time just by using them at all (and, in fact, over enough time even without using them they'll still oxidize from just the normal air.)\",\n",

       "  'First, I think it should use a lithium ion battery.',\n",

       "  'The second thing is I think it should have a bit more control by the user on the actual intervals used.',\n",
       "  \"I do understand that they don't want to overdo it -- too much ozone is a bad thing and people are really bad about not understanding stuff like this then buying such things and ramping them up to dangerous levels.\",\n",
